= Push to Production

== Register another GitHub App

There is a good chance you will continue to develop your GitHub App to add features and fix issues.
A good practice is to register a new GitHub App specific to production instead of reusing the one you created for development.

To do so, please follow the instructions in xref:register-github-app.adoc[Register a GitHub App].

== Production configuration

For a production configuration:

 * The webhook URL points to the root of your deployed GitHub App.
 * You have to define a webhook secret.

== Keep your secrets secret

Be careful to not expose your private key or your webhook secret in any sort as your GitHub App is publicly available.
